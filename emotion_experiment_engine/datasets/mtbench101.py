    eval_CM = "The capacity of a large language model to recall and utilize previously mentioned information from earlier in the conversation is a critical indicator of its conversational memory abilities. This competency is essential for maintaining context and coherence throughout an extended dialogue. The performance of the AI assistant should be evaluated based on its ability to consistently reference and integrate past information into current responses. The evaluation criteria are as follows:\n\
    \n\
    1.Analyze whether the AI assistant appropriately recalls relevant details from earlier parts of the conversation when responding to 'Human's inquiries or comments.\n\
    2.Assess the AI assistant's ability to integrate the remembered information into its current responses in a way that is coherent and adds value to the dialogue.\n\
    3.Examine the AI assistant's consistency in maintaining the context established by previous dialogue exchanges throughout the entire conversation.\n\
    4.Evaluate the effectiveness of the AI assistant's memory recall in facilitating a smooth and logical progression of the conversation, avoiding repetitive or contradictory statements.\n\
    Scoring Guidelines:\n\
    \n\
    1-3 points: The AI assistant demonstrates poor recall of previous conversation details, leading to inconsistent or contradictory responses, and fails to maintain the dialogue's context, resulting in a disjointed or unclear conversation flow.\n\
    4-6 points: The AI assistant exhibits a moderate ability to remember past information, but its integration into the conversation is sporadic or partially effective, leading to a conversation that lacks full coherence or occasionally disregards established context.\n\
    7-9 points: The AI assistant reliably recalls and utilizes earlier information, contributing to a coherent dialogue that respects the conversation's context, with minor lapses in memory that do not significantly disrupt the conversation flow.\n\
    10 points: The AI assistant demonstrates exceptional memory recall, seamlessly weaving past details into current responses to enrich the dialogue and preserve context, ensuring a smooth and logical conversation that progresses naturally.\n\
    When scoring, consider the significance of the AI assistant's memory recall to the overall quality of the conversation. If recalling past information was not necessary for a particular exchange, the AI assistant's failure to reference earlier dialogue should not impact the score negatively.
